# LIVE MONITORING ACTIVE - Employee Messaging System

## Monitoring Status: ✅ ACTIVE
**Started**: $(date)
**Target**: Detect when employee messaging system goes live on veriton.io

## Current Situation
❌ **Latest Deployments Failed**:
- Run 18759224366: Failed after ~18 minutes (19:09:33Z)

- Currently serving veriton.io (unchanged since 12:21:04 GMT)

## Monitoring System Setup
✅ **GitHub Actions Monitoring**: Checking every 2 minutes for new workflow runs
✅ **Live Deployment Tracking**: When new run detected, monitor until completion
✅ **veriton.io Verification**: Confirm deployment success and system goes live
✅ **Success Detection**: Will alert when employee messaging system becomes available

## Expected Indicators of Success
1. GitHub Actions shows "success" conclusion
2. veriton.io Last-Modified timestamp updates
3. X-GitHub-Request-Id changes to new deployment
4. Employee messaging features accessible and functional

## Monitoring Commands (Manual Verification)
```bash
# Check latest GitHub Actions run
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/buge4/buge4.github.io/actions/runs?per_page=1"

# Check veriton.io status

# Get specific run details
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/buge4/buge4.github.io/actions/runs/18759224366"
```

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for new deployment attempts
- Alert immediately upon successful deployment
- Verify employee messaging system functionality
