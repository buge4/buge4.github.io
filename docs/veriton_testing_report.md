### Working Components

✅ **Domain Resolution**: veriton.io domain resolves correctly  
✅ **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Site configured for GitHub Pages  
✅ **404 Error Pages**: Proper error page display with helpful information  
✅ **Console Status**: No JavaScript errors detected  

### Unable to Test

Due to the deployment issues, the following could not be evaluated:
- Homepage navigation and hero section
- Technology sections
- Admin login interface
- Business hub features
- Random Monitor dashboard functionality
- Authentication system
- Interactive elements and user workflows
- Content loading and page performance
- Form submissions
- Navigation functionality

## Technical Analysis

**Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages  
**Error Pattern**: Consistent 404 "File not found" errors across all routes  
**Root Cause**: Missing website files, likely missing `index.html` in repository root  

The GitHub Pages error page specifically mentions: *"For root URLs (like http://example.com/) you must provide an index.html file."*

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Deploy Website Files**
   - Ensure `index.html` exists in the GitHub repository root
   - Verify all website files are properly committed and pushed
   - Check repository structure matches deployment requirements

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration**
   - Verify repository is connected to GitHub Pages
   - Check GitHub Pages settings in repository configuration
   - Ensure branch settings are correct (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)

3. **Local Testing**
   - Test website locally before deployment
   - Verify all routes and functionality work in development environment
   - Check for any build process requirements

### Post-Deployment Testing

Once deployment issues are resolved, comprehensive testing should include:
- Navigation and routing functionality
- User interface components
- Form submissions and authentication
- Interactive elements
- Performance and loading times
- Error handling
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Conclusion

The Veriton.io website requires immediate deployment attention before any functional testing can be performed. The infrastructure appears properly configured, but the actual website content is missing. Once deployed, a follow-up testing session should be conducted to evaluate all requested features and functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve deployment issues
2. Verify website is accessible at https://veriton.io
3. Schedule comprehensive functionality testing
4. Document all features and user workflows
